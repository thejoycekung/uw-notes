# LET'S LEARN CS 246!
Note: Shell/bash will not be tested on the final exam.

## Testing
* testing != debugging
  * debugging implies that there is a known bug
  * you don't *know* if there are bugs until you test
* test do not prove correctness - only wrongness
* Human testing: code reviews, walking through
* Machine testing: black/grey/white box tests, i.e. how much you know about program
  * black box
    * various classes of input: positive/negative integers, numeric ranges
    * edge cases: boundaries of valid data
    * corner cases: multiple simultaneous boundaries
  * white box
    * make sure you test every single line of code (think Racket with the black highlights)
    * execute all logical paths
    * performance testing: is the program fast enough?
    * regression testing: if you rewrite something, will it break old (previously passed) test cases?

## Intro to C++
```C++
#include <iostream> // lets you print stuff
using namespace std; //useful so you don't have to keep std:: everything
// try to only use namespace std in .cc files

int main() {
  cout << "Hello world!" << endl;
}
```

* to allocate heap memory, use `new` and `delete`
  * `delete` works with `nullptr` so don't worry about that
  * `new[]` and `delete[]` for arrays
* to use old C headers, most of the time just add 'C' to the name: e.g. `<cstdio>`
* `extern int globalNum;` in a `.h` file allows you to use global variables
* **Runtime Type Information (RTTI)**: more info than at compile time

## I/O streams
* `#include <iostream>` to print
* `<iomanip`> if you want to change how you print somehow
* `<fstream>` to read from files
* `<sstream>` to use string streams
* `cin`, `cout`, `cerr` are the 3 streams
* use `<<` to read in, `>>` to print out
  * these operators return their respective streams
    * i.e. `operator<<` when used for istreams returns an istream
    * this makes sure that you can actually keep in/outputting content
      ```C++
      cin << x << y << z;
      cin << y << z;
      cin << z;
      ```
* input can be weird
  * `cin` will eat whitespace - use `getline(cin, s)` to read until newline
    * also works with other input streams
  * implicit conversion of `cin` to `bool` means that you can use it as a condition
  * if `cin` fails, it will set a failure flag - using `cin.clear()` will clear it for you
    * just remember to `cin.ignore()` so that you don't try and read it again
* file streams are easier in C++ than in C!
  * don't have to manually open/close files - once it goes out of scope, destructor called
    * can use `f.is_open()` to check if the file is open
* **STRINGSTREAMS ARE A THING**
  * How it works:
  * istringstream: strings go in, things come out
  * ostringstream: things go in, strings come out
    * use `oss.str()`

## Working with Strings
* `#include <string>` for all the magic
* C-style strings are an array of `char`s ended by `\0` but C++ style strings grow/shrink as needed
  * no longer need to realloc all the time !!!
* most of the operations are the same as C-style strings tbh
* I wrote "more funtimes in the notes" BUT I DON'T HAVE EXTRA NOTES LITERALLY WHY

## Function Overloading **pls review ???**
* defined multiple times
* different return types
* overloaded functions can have the same number of arguments (but must be different kinds)

## References
* L-values: think of them as a dereferenced const ptr
* R-values: anything that is temporary that will be destroyed soon
  * Note that r-values themselves are l-value references too
  * `std::move()` takes an l-value and outputs an r-value
* `int &x = y` - x is a reference to y, it can be used in the same way (is an alias)
* proper usage: as function params
  * **pass as constant reference** for anything larger than a ptr
    * if the fn needs a copy anyway, just use pass-by-value
    * using `const` means they can't fuck up all your data
    * also faster than pass-by-value

```C++
int f(int &n) {..}
int g(const int &n) {..}

f(5); // ILLEGAL
g(5); // allowed - you can't change it anyways so why not?
// 5 gains a temporary location on the stack just so n has something to point at
```

### Please never:
* leave them uninitialized: `int &x;`
* initialize it with something that has no address: `int &x = 3; int &y = a + b;`
* create a pointer to a reference: `int &*x = y;`
  * most of the time you just want a pointer to the Real Thing™
  * references to a pointer are ALLOWED though: `int *&x = y; //is okay`
* create a reference to a reference: `int &&x = y;`
  * this refers to an **r-value** reference, not an **l-value**
* create an array of references: `int &r[3] = {x, y, z};`
  * WHY ??? would you want to do that thing

## Compilation (Lecture 7)
`g++ -std=C++14 -Wall hello.cc -o hello`
* `g++`: the compiler lmfao
* `std=C++14`: using C++14 standard
* `-Wall`: display all warnings
* `-g`: allows you to use Valgrind
* `hello`: names the executable in the end

* use `-c` during compiler args to compile only, but not link
  * use `className::fnName` to ensure `fnName` is scoped within `className` at compile time
* use `-fno-elide-constructors` to make sure that every single constructor runs
  * will compile a lot slower though, warning

### Preprocessor
* modifies program before compiler
* can also use to nest comments
* `#define` defines variables at compile-time
  * way to create compile-time constants easily (and archaically)
  * avoid this by just using `const` like a normal person
* `#ifndef` defines variables if they *haven't* been defined already
  * `#if 0` makes sure that whatever's inside will always be removed at compilation
* use for include guards

#### Never:
* compile `.h` files
* include `.cc` files
* put `using namespace std;` in header files - forces clients to use this namespace too

### Makefile

Compile using `make`!

```shell
CXX=g++ " compiler
CXXFLAGS=-std=c++14 -Wall -Werror -MMD " normal flags you use during compile time
OBJECTS=main.o book.o textbook.o comic.o " compiled executables including main
DEPENDS=${OBJECTS:.o=.d} " keep track of what depends on what, what needs to be recompiled
EXEC=main " name of final executable

" use the above variables
${EXEC}: ${OBJECTS}
⇥${CXX} ${CXXFLAGS} ${OBJECTS} -o ${EXEC}
-include ${DEPENDS}
clean: " clean up your directory after making
⇥rm *.o main
.PHONY: clean
```

### Compilation Dependencies
* only `#include` what you need!
* in headers, `#include "a.h"` if:
  * B *is a* A
  * B *owns a* A (e.g. as a field other than a ptr)
* if B has a ptr field to A or has a function that takes/returns an A, just put a forward declare
  * i.e. write `class A;` before B's definition
* in `.cc` files, `#include "a.h"` if:
  * B needs one of A's methods (A is a pointer field in B)

## Classes and Objects (Lecture 8)
**class**: basically a struct, but fields are private by default (unlike struct)
  * you can put functions in a class!
    * called *member function* (or *method*)
    * adding `const` after a method declaration is a promise not to modify object field
    * e.g. `float grades() const;`
  * *object*: an instance of a class
  * `this`: hidden ptr to the object where the method was called
    * e.g. `billy.grades(); // billy == *this`
  * `static`: useful for keeping track of classes, but doesn't belong inside any specific object
    * e.g. you want to keep count of how many students there are
    ```C++
    // student.h
    class Student {
      ...
      public:
       static int numInstances;
       Student(...): ... {
         ++numInstances;
       }
    };

    // student.cc
    int Student::numInstances = 0; //defining it here prevent 103894012 copies being made
    ```
    * `static` member functions also exist, but they can only access `static` data

**Single Responsibility Principle**: A class should have only *one* reason to change, i.e. it should only be in charge of *one* thing.

* most operators must be written as standalone fns, not as methods
  * `operator=`
  * `operator[]`
  * `operator->`
  * `operator()`
  * `operatorT` (implicit conversion to type T)
* if you need an array of objects
  * either go stack or heap arrays
  * don't be fancy schmancy dude

* classes can be initialized using C-style
  * e.g. `Student billy {60, 70, 80}`
* better: **constructor**: method that does initialization for you!
  * can continue to use C-style syntax
  * if it exists, args passed
  * if not, syntax initializes fields
  * advantages:
    * can set default parameters
    * overloading
    * sanity checks: ensure values are correct
* every class comes with a default constructor that takes no args
  * sometimes it literally does nothing: `Vec v; // nothing happened`
  * the default constructor only constructs fields that are objects
  * C doesn't actually give a default constructor (lol) but C++ does!
  * if you overwrite the default constructor in any way, it disappears

### Member Initialization List
* allows you to initialize `const`s and references
* allows you to define fields and initialize them in one single step
  * can also define them to be some expression
* can also have extra steps inside constructor body if necessary

```C++
class Student {
  const int id;
  int assn, mt, final;
  ...
  Student(int id, int assn, int mt, int final): id{id}, assn{assn}, mt{mt}, final{final} {}
};
```

With inheritance, you can initialize the superclass first, and then any extra fields in the subclass.

```C++
class Text: public Book {
  string title; // inherited from Book
  ...
  string topic; // not inherited
  public:
   Text(string title, ... string topic): Book{title, ...}, topic{topic} {}
};
```

Use the keyword `explicit` to prevent implicit conversion if the object only has one argument.
* will not compile

* Order:
  * Space allocated
  * Superclass part is constructed (if using inheritance)
  * Fields' constructors run in declaration order (regardless of MIL)
  * Constructor body runs

### Big 5

**Rule of 5**: normally, if you have to write any of the 5, you probably have to write all of them.
* exception: virtual destructors
* if you don't write any, you'll get the distinct pleasure of using defaults!

For most of the Big 5 (except moves), when working with inheritance, the subclass will inherit the superclass's constructor.

#### Destructor
`~Student(); // declaring a destructor for class Student`
* runs when object is destroyed (i.e. popped off stack, or `delete` is called)
* how 2 destroy:
  * destructor body runs
  * fields' destructors (if objects) run in reverse declaration order
  * superclass part destroyed (if using inheritance)
  * space deallocated
* if you have some form of linked list, make sure to do a deep delete
  * e.g. `Node *np = new Node {1, new Node {2, new Node {3, nullptr}}};`
    * when `np` goes out of scope, the ptr is reclaimed (bc stack)
    * when `delete np;` is called, the node containing 1 (i.e. the first node) is deleted
      * rest of list is leaked
  * call `delete next;` inside destructor body to full delete
* if dtor belongs to a superclass, the dtor should be declared `virtual`
* dtors should ***never*** throw exceptions unless they are tagged with `noexcept(false)`
  * a dtor must run during stack unwinding, so you'll have *two* active, unhandled exceptions
    * your program will not be happy
    * it will immediately abort (as per the standard)
    * don't do it

#### Copy Constructor
`Student(const Student &other): id{other.id}, assn{other.assn}, mt{other.mt}, final{other.final} {}`
* runs when:
  * object initialized using another object
  * object is passed by value
  * object is returned by a function
  * `.emplace_back()` in a vector, and no move ctor defined (or move ctor unsafe)
* must pass obj by reference in copy ctor (otherwise, infinite recursion)
* default copy ctor fails with dynamic memory allocation - *shallow copy*
  * `Node *n = new Node {1, new Node {2, new Node {3, nullptr}}};`
  * `Node m = *n;` only copies the first node, points to the rest of `n`'s list
  * `Node *p = new Node {*n};` points to a copy of first node, then points to rest of `n`'s list
* to *deep copy* (i.e. actually copy), use an if statement:
  * `Node(const Node &other): data{other.data}, next{other.next ? new Node {other.next} : nullptr} {}`
  * checks whether the next node actually exists before allocating more memory for it
* with inheritance:
  * `Text::Text(const Text &other): Book{other}, topic{other.topic} {}`

#### Move Constructor
`Node(Node &&other): data{other.data}, next{other.next} { other.next = nullptr; }`
* essentially: take their data, stab them, and run
  * saying `next{other.next}` copies all their pointers
  * setting `other.next = nullptr` means that all their data is GONE
* basically runs whenever the copy constructor doesn't run, or if obj. is temporary
  * bc faster (data is deleted after)
  * mostly just when object is returned by a fn (way faster)
  * also for `.emplace_back()` in a vector
* with inheritance:
  * `Text::Text(Text&& other): Book{std::move(other)}, topic{std::move(other.topic)} {}`
    * `other` is an lvalue (even though they refer to rvalues), so it will invoke the copy ctor
    * using `std::move` lets us treat `other` as an rvalue instead
* should be indicated as nothrow: `C(C &&other) noexcept { .. }`

#### Copy Assignment Operator
```C++
Node &operator=(const Node&other) {
  if (*this == other) return this; // check if the thing you're copying is just you
  data = other.data;
  next = other.next ? new Node {*other.next} : nullptr; //doing this w/o checking if other == *this would result in throwing away old data
  return *this:
}
```
* like a copy ctor, but for objs that have already been constructed before
  * you're just reassigning values

#### Move Assignment Operator
```C++
Node &operator=(Node &&other) {
  using std::swap;
  swap(data, other.data);
  swap(next, other.next);
  return *this;
}
```
* `swap` can be found by including `<utility>`
* successfully stole new data AND destroyed old data
* with inheritance:
```C++
Text &Text::operator=(Text&& other) {
  Book::operator=(std::move(other));
  topic = (std::move(other.topic));
  return *this;
}
```

##### Copy/Move Elision
**elision**: to skip over, to leave out
* compiler is allowed to skip over using copy/move ctors if it deems faster
  * e.g. `Vec makeAVec() {return {0,0}; //invokes basic ctor}`
  * if you call `Vec v = makeAVec();` it'll just write the result directly in to `v`
* this is allowed! even if it would change program behaviour (e.g. ctors print stuff)
* basically, just write your constructors so that your compiler won't go rogue

## Invariants and Encapsulation
**invariant**: statement that holds true
  * e.g. if we define `Node`s to have a ptr to `next` but they point to something on the stack ???
    * can't guarantee that as an invariant

**encapsulation**: we want clients to treat our objects like black boxes (capsules)
  * if they don't know how to fuck with it, they *can't*
  * creates abstraction
  * allows us to regain control of our objects
  * only methods should be public, not fields

* this can be hard to work with when you need them for stuff like *AHEM ITERATORS*
  * if classes can access each others' methods, then clients can too
  * possible soln: use `friend`
    * e.g. if List needs to be able to make an Iterator, then Iterator friends List
    ```C++
    class List {
      ...
      public:
       class Iterator {
         Node *np;
         explicit Iterator(Node *np): ... {}
         public:
          ...
          friend class List; // THIS LINE
       };
    };
    ```
    * note that friendship is not mutual: List can see all of Iterator, but Iterator cannot see all of List
    * friends are finicky: if you have too many of them, it probably means that if you update one, you're going to have to update them ALL
    * prolly best solution for `operator<<` (can't be member, but needs fields)
  * other soln: use accessor/mutator methods (getters + setters)
    * e.g. `int getSize()` or `void setName(string name)`

**end of midterm material !!!**

## System Modelling: UML
* building an object-oriented system requires planning and organization
* **UML**: Unified Modelling Language
* represent a class like so:

| Vec              |
| ---------------- |
| -x: Integer      |
| -y: Integer      |
| +getX(): Integer |
| +getY(): Integer |


* `-` private
* `+` public
* `#` protected
* `_` static (underline)
* can represent virtual or PVM using *cursive*
* an abstract class's name is written in *italics*
* OWNS-A (compos): Black diamond
* HAS-A (aggreg): Open diamond
* IS-A (inheri): Open triangle

### Composition ('owns a')
* embedding one object inside another
* typically, if A *owns* B:
  * B has no identity outside A
  * if A is destroyed, so is B
  * if A is copied, so is B (deep copy)
* e.g. a car *owns* 4 wheels
* modelled in UML as: ◆⟶
  * e.g. A◆⟶B, "A owns a B"
    * can add multiplicities, e.g. "A owns 4 Bs" means add a 4 to the arrow

### Aggregation ('has a')
* containing another class, but the class has independent existence
* e.g. a pond *has* ducks, a catalogue *has* car parts
* typically, if A *has* B:
  * B has existence apart from its association with A
  * if A is destroyed, B is not
  * if A is copied, B is not (shallow)
    * aka, copies of A will share the same B
* modelled in UML as: ♢⟶
  * e.g. A ♢⟶ B, "A has a B"
    * like composition, can add multiplicities to arrow

### Inheritance ('is a')
* when things are basically the same thing, but with extra features
  * i.e. they *inherit* features
* e.g. a Textbook *is a* Book, and a Comic *is a* Book, but they are different kinds of books (both from each other and from most books)
* in C, we could:
  * use a `union` (basically a struct)
    * e.g. `union BookType {Book *b; Text *t; Comic *c;}; BookType myBooks[20];`
    * each instance then is *either* a Book *or* a Text *or* a comic but *not* all 3
    * disadvantages:
      * it's only valid for 3 book types - if you think of more, you must rewrite the union
      * `union` doesn't remember what was put in
        * what if you put in a Text and try to take out a Comic ?!?!!
  * use an array of `void *`
    * if there's anything I've learned in 136 and this course, it's that `void *` are bad and arrays are annoying
* in C++, we have a **superclass** (e.g. Book) that **subclasses** (e.g. Text, Comic) inherit from, by adding `:public superClass` in their declaration
  * e.g. `class Text: public Book;`
  * if a class is *not* mean to have subclasses, you should declare it `final`
* subclasses inherit fields and methods from the base class
  * e.g. Text and Comic will both have title/numPages/author fields
  * any method can be called on Book can be called on Text/Comic
* even though subclasses inherit fields/methods from the base class, they cannot see the superclass's private data
  * this prevents someone from coming in and creating another subclass to violate any invariants
  * workarounds: use `protected` methods
    * keep fields private, but set accessors/mutators as `protected` (as opposed to `public`) so that subclasses may access
* modelled in UML as: ◁-
  * e.g. A ◁- B, "B inherits from A"

* if you declare a Comic as a Book, you might **slice** it:
  * `Book b = Comic {"big comic", ... 40, ...};`
  * this tries to fit a `Comic`-sized obj into a `Book`-sized one
  * chops off the `hero` field in `Comic`, leaving it with only `Book` fields
  * avoid slicing by accessing obj through ptrs
    * make sure it's a Comic ptr though!

#### Multiple Inheritance
Surprise, bitches! A class can inherit from more than one class (see fig 3.0 under 'table' in OneNote).

If B and C both inherit from A, and D inherits from B and C, should there be 1 A part or 2 A parts in D???
* 2 is the default (i.e. they inherit from different A's)
* to make it 1 part (i.e. deadly diamond of death):
  * make A virtual base class (use virtual inheritance)
  * B and C both `virtual public A`
  * fun fact: this is how `iostream` works 😱

|
| --- |
| vptr |
| B fields |
| vptr |
| C fields |
| D fields |
| vptr |
| A fields |

B b;

|
| --- |
| vptr |
| B fields |
| vptr |
| A fields |

B needs to be laid out so that we can find its A part, but the distance to A part varies.
* Use vtables to find the location of the superclass object

Notice also that the diagram doesn't look like A/B/C/D simultaneously
* But slices of it do look like A/B/C/D
* Ptr assignment among A/B/C/D changes the address stored in the ptr  
`D *d = ... ; A *a = d; // changes the address`
* `static_cast, dynamic cast` under multiple inheritance will also change the value of the ptr
  * `reinterpret_cast` will not.

#### Abstract Classes
**virtual method**: compiler chooses which class method to run
  * based on actual obj type at runtime
  * method is `virtual` in superclass, subclasses may `override` it
  * dtor should **always** be declared `virtual` if the class is meant to have subclasses
    * *even if* the dtor doesn't do anything (i.e. PVM)
    * sublcasses should *not* `override` the dtor
  * methods are **pure virtual** if they are set to 0 (i.e. have no implementation)
  * **partial assignment**: when your copy/move assign operators are not declared `virtual`/`override`
    * but adding those violates the 'is-a' relationship as a Text can then be assigned from *any* Book
    * to avoid partial/mixed assignment, just have fucking abstract base classes dude (or dynamic_cast)
    * superclass --> subclass
      * slicing is subclass --> superclass

**abstract class**: any class with at least one PVM
  * all superclasses should be abstract
  * abstract classes can't be instantiated (i.e. you can't create objects of them)
  * purpose is to organize subclasses
  * subclasses remain abstract until they implement the PVM
  * non-abstract classes are called **concrete**

##### Vtables / Vptrs
For classes with >= 1 virtual method, compiler creates a table of fn ptrs: the **vtable**.

| C   |
| --- |
| f   |
| g   |
| ~C  |

`C` objs will then have an extra ptr (the **vptr**) that points to `C`'s vtable (see Fig 2 under 'table' in OneNote).

Calling a virtual method (recall: this happens from runtime):
1. follow vptr --> vtable
1. fetch ptr to actual method from vtable
1. follow fn ptr and call fn

Virtual method calls uncur overhead cost (small) in time and space.
* takes time to chase ptrs
* adding vptr is space

## Templates
**template**: class parameterized by a type

# PLEASE LEARN ABOUT TEMPLATES [Lecture 16]

### Standard Template Library
* large number of useful templates to use when coding (makes ur life so much easier)

#### Vector
* `#include <vector>` to use
* basically a dynamic length array
* two ways to construct:
  * `vector<int> v{4,5};` gives [4, 5]
  * `vector<int> v(4,5);` gives [5, 5, 5, 5]
* to add more items: `v.emplace_back(6);`
  * offers strong guarantee
    * either uses copy ctor (strong guarantee)
    * or move ctor (if nothrow)
* can access each index by using `[]`: `v[i]`
  * `[]` doesn't check whether you go out of bounds
  * `v.at(i)` does check tho - throws `std::out_of_range` when it fails
* to loop over vector, there are a few options:
  * be normal: `for(int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i)`
  * use an iterator: `for(vector<int>::iterator it=v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it)`
  * use an iterator and use the shortcut: `for(auto n:v)`
* to iterate in reverse, it's the same thing as normal iterators
* to remove the last element, use `v.pop_back();`
* we can also remove elements by index: `v.erase()`, which takes an iterator as a parameter (and returns an iterator)
  * eg. `auto it = v.erase(v.begin());` erases item 0
  * `auto it = v.erase(v.begin() + 3);` erases item 3
    * found using ptr arithmetic
  * `it = v.erase(it);` erases the next item
  * `it = v.erase(v.end() - 1);` erases the last item

If a vector contains pointers:
* if raw ptrs:
  * must delete ptrs yourself bc ptrs don't have dtors (basic type)
  * vector can't delete bc doesn't know if ptrs own their pointed objs
  * `for (auto &x:v) delete x;`
* if unique ptrs:
  * dtors will run, objs deleted

#### Map
* `#include <map>` to use
* good for creating dictionaries

```
#include <map>
using namespace std;
map<string, int> m;
m["abc"] = 1;
m["def"] = 4;
cout << m["ghi"]; // prints 0 bc key doesn't exist
// the ctor inserts a default value, e.g. int is 0
cout << m["abc"]; 
m.erase("abc"); 
if (m.count("def")) { ... } // 0 = not found; 1 = found
```

#### Algorithm
* `#include <algorithm>` to use template fns
  * many v useful on iterators
* `for_each` is basically iterating through
* `find`: returns It to first elem in [first, last) that matches a val
  * or last itself if val is not found
* `count`: similar to `find`, but finds # of occurrences of val
* `OutIter copy(InIter first, InIter last, OutIter result)` copies one container range [first, last) to another, starting at result
  * Note: does not allocate memory - you have to do that
* `OutIter transform(InIter first, InIter last, OutIter result, Fn f)` works similar to `map` in Racket

##### Template Functions
```
template<typename T>T min(T x, T y) {
  return x < y ? x : y;
}

int f() {
  int x = 1, y = 2;
  int z = min(x, y); // don't have to say min<int>
}
```

C++ can infer that T=int from the types of x, y.
* applies to fn templates only
* if it can't determine T, you can tell it: `z = min<int>(x, y);`
  * using `auto` works too: `auto f = min(1.0, 3.0);` gives `f` as a `double`

Examples:
* swap
* move
* dynamic cast

##### Function Objects
* write `operator()` for objects
* use like: `transform(v.begin(), v.end(), w.begin(), Plus1{});`
  * brace brackets construct object (using the class name only won't work)
* use fn objects to maintain state (e.g. like static instances)
* if fn object is v temporary, use C++'s version of lambda:
  * `int x = count_if(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int n){return n%2 == 0;});`
  * `[]` is called *capture clause*, or *lambda specifier*

#### Iterator (STL)

```C++
#include <iterator>
vector<int> v {1,2,3,4,5};
ostream_iterator<int> out {cout, ", "};
copy(v.begin(), v.end(), out); // Prints "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, "
```

Now let's fix that problem with w needing to have memory allocated.

```C++
copy(v.begin(), v.end(), back_inserter(w));
```

`back_inserter` is available for any container that supports `push_back` - it copies to the end of `w`, allocating space as it goes.

## Exceptions
Main problem: function can *detect* error but doesn't know how to handle - client can *respond*, but can't detect
* in C, errors were awkward (status codes, setting global error variables)
  * needed to use if-statement wrapping
  * encouraged unsafe programming
* in C++, function *raises* an exception
  * by default, execution stops (an intentional crash)
  * exceptions tend to be objects, e.g. `out_of_range` is a class
    * throwing them invokes a ctor call
    * you can write your own exception classes too!
      * just catch them by reference to avoid copying
* we can write handlers to *catch* exceptions & deal with them
  * handlers may throw other exceptions
    * e.g. `throw SomeOtherError` or just `throw;` to throw the same exception
      * note it is just `throw;` and has no parameters, this is intentional
      * if the exception `s` inherits from another type, we don't want to throw the superclass type over - we want to throw `s`
  * handlers may be catch-all: `catch(...)`
* some standard exceptions:
  * `out_of_range`
  * `length.error`: string/vector too large (and can't resize)
  * `bad_alloc`: when `new` fails

```
#include <stdexcept>
...
try {
  cout << v.at(10 000) << endl; // what do if no error/code that could throw
} catch (std::out_of_range theExn) { //out_of_range is a class
  cerr << "range error" << endl;
}
cout << "carry on" << endl; 
```

**stack unwinding**: the function rabbit hole (aka stack) will go backwards until something that can handle the exception is found

Avoid throwing many exceptions willy-nilly - it *will* slow down your program. (As evidenced by `$ time ./prog`)

**exception safety**: making sure program is still runnable after throwing an exception
* leads to RAII

3 levels of exception safety for any given fn:
1. Basic guarantee
  * if exception occurs, the program will be in *some* valid state
  * "valid state" is a pretty strong term tbh 
2. Strong guarantee
  * if exception is raised in fn, state will be like fn was never called
3. No-throw guarantee
  * fn will never throw an exception
  * fn will always do its task 
  * moves + swaps should be noexcept

If a fn C::F has fns A and B that both have strong guarantee:
* if A throws: nothing has happened yet (Y)
* if B throws: must undo A effects to ensure F has strong guarantee

To ensure strong guarantee in F, use pImpl idiom with C:
* C has field p which is pImpl
* in C::F, make a temp pImpl
* call A and B on temp
* swap impl and temp
* bam! C::F has strong guarantee now ~

If A or B offer no exception safety, then neither can C::F.

####Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)
Every resource should be wrapped in a statically-allocated object, whose job is to free it.
* as soon as we acquire the resource, we should initialize it in a statically-allocated object
  * statically-allocated means that it is tied to an object's lifetime (can be on heap or stack)

## Design Patterns
**design pattern**: good soln to a programming problem that arises frequently
* program to the interface, not the implementation
* abstract base classes define the interface
  * work with ptrs to abstract bases
  * call the abstract methods
  * can swap in/out concrete subclasses
* allows for abstraction over variety of behaviours

### Iterator
1. create a class that manages access to list nodes (abstraction of a ptr)
2. walk through the list w/o touching actual ptrs
    * inspo: `for (int *p = a; p != a+n; ++p)` (i.e. ptr arithmetic)

ok here just have a giant bit of code tbh

```C++
class List {
  struct Node;
  Node *theList = nullptr;
  public:
   ...
   class Iterator {
     Node *p;
     public:
      explicit Iterator(Node *p): p{p} {} // note how we use the keyword explicit here
      // it's bc Iterator is a 1-field class; we want to avoid implicit conversion
      int &operator*() {return p->data;} // lets us use the * operator as a pointer
      Iterator &operator++() {p = p->next; return *this;} // lets us actually ... iterate lol
      bool operator!=(const Iterator &other) const {return p != other.p;}
   };
   Iterator begin() {return Iterator{theList};}
   Iterator end() {return Iterator{nullptr};}
};
```

We can use the Iterator in `main`.
```C++
for(List::Iterator it = l.begin(); it != l.end(); ++it) {
  cout << *it << endl; // bc the iterator is just a pointer to the item in the list
}
```

Can make iterator class more abstract by making ... an AbstractIterator.

```C++
class AbstractIterator {
  public:
    virtual int& operator*() = 0;
    virtual AbstractIterator &operator++() = 0;
    virtual bool operator!= (const AbstractIterator& other) const = 0;
    virtual ~AbstractIterator();
};

class List {
  ..
  public:
    class Iterator:public AbstractIterator {};
};

class Set {
  ..
  public:
    class Iterator:public AbstractIterator {};
};
```

We can then write code to operator over iterators:

```C++
void for_each(AbstractIterator& start, AbstractIterator& finish, void (*f) (int)) {
  while (start != finish) {
    f(*start);
    ++start;
  }
}
```

### Observer
Goal: Allow classes to be aware of events.  
A `Subject` *has* `Observer`s.
* e.g. cells in a spreadsheet
* see fig. 1.0

![fig 1.0](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Observer.svg)

We call "registering" an Observer "attaching" it.

Sequence of method calls:
1. `Subject`'s state is updated
2. `Subject::notifyObservers()` (could be called by `Subject`, or some external controller)
    * Calls every `Observer`'s `notify`
3. Each `Observer` calls `ConcreteSubject::getState` to query the state and react appropriately.

ConcreteSubject and ConcreteObserver are where the real implementations are held.

### Decorator
Goal: Add features/functionality at runtime.  
A `Component` *has* a ConcreteComponent and a Decorator, which *has* ConcreteDecorators. The Concrete Component and Decorator (and ConcreteDecorators) *are* all Components as well.
* e.g. an Image and its various operations (flip, sepia, rotate)
* similar to a LinkedList: every Node *is* a List, and every Node *has* a List
* see fig. 2.0

### Factory Method (Virtual Constructor)
Goal: Not knowing what object to construct, the superclass writes a method to let subclasses override and decide for themselves.  
A superclass writes a PVM (*factory method*) and the subclasses that inherit from it implement the factory method to create the objects they want.

### Template Method Pattern
Goal: Subclasses want to override superclass behaviour, but other aspects must remain the same.
* Superclass: private PVM
* Subclass: public overrided method

#### Non-Virtual Interface (NVI) Idiom
* Public virtual method is two things:
  * Public: part of interface to client
    * Indicates provided behaviour with pre/post-conditions
  * Virtual: interface to subclasses
    * "Hook" to insert specialized behaviour
* Hard to separate interfaces if in same method
* What if you later want to separate behaviour in to 2?
  * Forced to change client interface
  * How can you force overriding fn's to obey pre/post conditions?

NVI Idiom says:
* All public methods should be non-virtual
* All virtual methods should be non-public (private or protected)
  * Except destructor. Always destructor.

The NVI Idiom generalizes the template method: Every virtual method should be part of a template method.

### Visitor
Goal: Has different behaviour depending on what class we are visiting.
* can also be used to add functionality to existing classes w/o changing/recompiling the classes themselves
  * very very special one-offs
  * good for when you don't have permission
  * not really first go-to tho
* adds to the template method idea
* requires that you know *all* the different kinds of `Client`s

We have two classes, `ClientA` and `ClientB`, which both *are* `Client`s. `Client`s may choose to accept(visitor), but they each do it differently (i.e. `accept(visitor)` is PVM).

`ClientA` accepts visitors by overriding it to say that the visitor should know who it is visiting.
* i.e.: `ClientA::accept(visitor) {visitor.visit(this);}`

Meanwhile, `ClientB` does the same thing, but says that the visitor is visiting Client B.
* i.e.: `ClientB::accept(visitor) {visitor.visit(this);}`

`Visitor` knows that `ClientA` and `ClientB` are different, so its `visit` method is overloaded to take in a `ClientA` *or* a `ClientB`.

### Bridge (Pimpl Idiom)
Goal: separate the private implementation and the public abstraction of a class.
* e.g. an `XWindow` *has* an `XWindowImpl` class
* public class: abstract methods, pointer to private class
* private class: fields only
* by hiding the implementation in the private class, if the impl needs to change, no need to recompile every single fucking class that inherits from 

To expand pImpl to Bridge, just have multiple implementations.

## Measures of Design Quality
***Goal: low coupling, high cohesion.***

**coupling**: how much do 2 program modules depend on each other?
  * ideal: 1 module.
    * since there's nothing to couple with, you don't depend on anything
  * low: communicate with function calls (basic params/results)
  * highest: modules are mutual friends
    * changing one requires changing the other

**cohesion**: how closely are elements of a module related?
  * ideal: everything is its own module
  * low: random grab bag of elements
    * poorly organized, hard to maintain/reuse
  * high: elements cooperate to perform exactly one task

## Model-View-Controller
* architecture concept (i.e. building your program)
* separate data/state from presentation of data and control of data
* Model: data
  * Doesn't need to know how it's being viewed (i.e. Observer)
  * Can also communicate through controller
* View: how user sees data
* Controller: how model is manipulated
  * Mediates control flow between model/view

## Smart Pointers
`class std::unique_ptr<T>` takes a `T*` in its ctor
* basically how to allocate dynamic memory but make sure it's still exception safe
* dtor deletes the ptr for you, so it's still safe!
* can dereference just like a ptr

```C++
unique_ptr<MyClass> p { new MyClass { ... } };
unique_ptr<MyClass> q = make_unique<MyClass>( /* ctor args*/);
```

Note: you *can't* copy a `unique_ptr` - they can only be moved.
* makes sure that you can't delete the same ptr twice (i.e. double-free)
* this means that `unique_ptr`s are just moved when they're returned from fn's

Use `std::shared_ptr`s if you really want to have 2 ptrs pointing to the same thing. 
* `shared_ptr`s have a *reference count* - counts how many are pointed to that object
* memory is only freed when the # of `shared_ptr`s pointing to it hit 0

Conclusion:
* Use `shared_ptrs` and `unique_ptrs` for ownership.
* Use raw (real) ptrs for non-owning ptrs.

## Casting
1. `static_cast`: "sensible casts"
  * e.g. casting `double` to `int`, superclass ptr to subclass ptr
  * if it's not actually a subclass ptr ur fucked, it's undefined behaviour
2. `reintepret_cast`: unsafe, implementation-specific, ~weird~ conversions
  * assert your dominance over the compiler
  * show them who's boss
  * tell them you KNOW that it's the other type
  * TRUST ME, COMPILER, I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING
3. `const_cast`: for adding/removing `const`
  * useful when trying to pass `const` value to non-const fn
  * this is a promise not to change the `const` value
4. `dynamic_cast`
  * used to safely cast a superclass ptr (or ref) into a ptr (or ref) to a subclass
  * if the cast is invalid: raises `bad_cast` exn
  * can also try using smart ptrs: `static_pointer_cast`, `const_pointer_cast`, `dynamic_pointer_cast`
    * will map `shared_ptrs` to `shared_ptrs`
